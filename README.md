Advanced Topics In Mobile Computing

Week 1: Make a useful and efficient toolbar. Toolbars can be very useful and is something I have not yet created.

Week 2: Create a tabbed application. As opposed to tabs, buttons can be bulky and unattractive.

Week 3: Utilize colors and space to better understanding android layout design principles. My previously created applications lack a pleasing aesthetic.

Week 4: Create an application that identifies an active internet connection, and perform a certain action only when there is an active internet connection. This will be useful for the final project.

Week 5: Work with custom views and Canvas, as well as the DrawOn method.

Week 6: Midterm:  Create a video and audio player with the ability to very specifically organize my files into folders and playlists that can be easily accessed and viewed. I have never found an app on the play store that lets me do this in the specific way I want. So, in addition to learning, it will be personally useful.

Week 7: Midterm: Continued.

Week 8: Review external databases and create a firebase. This will most likely be the method I will use to communicate with excel.

Week 9: Build an application that sends reminder notifications. Then create an application that tests the limit of the number of notifications received at once without crashing the emulator.

Week 10: https://www.codementor.io/@ebiigweze/android-development-beginner-to-advanced-    m3i1ve6y7. I was thinking of something in the advanced section, like functional programming or unit testing. This is really the only week that I donâ€™t have a definitive app to build for. If you have any ideas or suggestions please let me know.

Week 11: Learn to communicate with excel.

Week 12: Final Project: Create an application that tracks both relative location and how long someone stays within a certain radius of an address (location). The application will communicate the address and time at that address to an excel spreadsheet where the data is added.
